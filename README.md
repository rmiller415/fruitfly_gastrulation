A project I am working on to show how forces propogate through a fruitfly embryo during the gastrulation phase of development. 
I have downloaded a video from youtube containing microscopy images and am using computer vision and various image editing, masking, and analysis tools to mask and segment the images.
After masking is complete it will find the vertices and treat each cell as a polygon and calculate the normal vector for this polygon. By comparing the normal vectors for each cell between
frames I hope to visualize the forces involved in causing bi-lateral symmetry in fruit flies.
